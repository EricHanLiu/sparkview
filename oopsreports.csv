In SEO, there is no other way for the department to know how many hours need to be billed to a client. This document needs to be up to date at all times, especially if billing depends on it.

A structure needs to be put in place in the SEO department in order for us to make sure we provide the right amount of hours. Double-checking each team member's hours and confirming with AMs doesn't seem to be enough, we need to sit down with management and processes to find a solution.

I was replacing Xavier for a call with Adroll and the client to set up new campaigns. There was a conflict in Xaviers calendar as the call with Adroll couldnt be moved. Everything on the call was okay, except that the client was not aware that I was replacing him. It is not a big deal, but it is something that should have been communicated.",4/12/2019,Planbox,,Client Services,No One,,,,,
